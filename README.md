# About

This is a simple web app for a pizza show. Written as a test task for a junior frontend developer.

# Used

Frontend: JS, React, Redux, React Router, antd ui-kit

Backend: Python3, Flask, MySQL

# Deploy

So you basically need to install all the dependencies for both Python and JS, build the React app and you can deploy it wherever you want

# Cons

OK, the db credentials are exposed, idc, cause it's on a free hosting, which is gonna delete the db in a couple of weeks anyway.

The passwords are raw-stored in the db, in a commercial project, I'd have hashed them in frontend, and transfer in hashed form to the db.

# Credit

Images, names, descriptions are from DODO pizza, i believe it's not an issue, as this is a non-commercial project, done with educational & testing purposes.
